- Collect more 2d approaches
- explain how 2d approaches handle large datasets
- propose a solution for 3d based on papers and existing research
- write java code for it

intermediate format will be necessary
off format for princeton benchmark
where to get that dataset???
different model sizes + parameter + weights file
quickly gets too big... => more than 28 not possible with non uniform feature extractors
try out uniform feature extractors

test on empty data
test with noise data
use rgba?
use single value? (maybe even boolean)
off voxelization?
