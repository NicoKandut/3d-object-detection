- Collect more 2d approaches
- explain how 2d approaches handle large datasets
- propose a solution for 3d based on papers and existing research
- write java code for it    

intermediate format will be necessary BFF ðŸ’–
different model sizes + parameter + weights file
try out uniform feature extractors

test on empty data
test with noise data
off voxelization for empty/full chunks? skip them completely?
